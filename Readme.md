# How to extend the auto-search feature of the GridLookUpEdit to search by multiple columns

Starting from version 11.1, we added the [SearchLookUpEdit](https://documentation.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraEditors.SearchLookUpEdit.class) editor that provides the capability to perform searching through all columns out of the box.

This example demonstrates how to achieve this functionality via the editor.
